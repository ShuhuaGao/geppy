    "# Numerical expression inference problem: numerical constant finding with ephemeral numerical constant (ENC)\n",
    "In this example, we aim to identify a mathematicalfunction $f$ from the given input-ouput data such that the function $f$ can produce the expected ouput given a certain input. This is a typical [symbolic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_regression) problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Symbolic regression is a type of regression analysis that searches the space of mathematical expressions to find the model that best fits a given dataset, both in terms of accuracy and simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "which is most commonly solved with genetic programming and its variant, gene expression programming (GEP), presented here. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before continuing this example, you'd better first go through the two fundamental tutorials listed below to get familiar with GEP and *geppy*:\n",
    "+ [Introduction to gene expression programming](https://geppy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro_GEP.html)\n",
    "+ [Overview of geppy for Gene Expression Programming (GEP)](https://geppy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference of this problem w.r.t the [Boolean function identification](Boolean_function_identification.ipynb) problem is that generally a mathematical model involves constant coefficients, which is more challenging for both genetic programming (GP) and GEP. The standard way to handle numerical constants in GP is to use ephemeral numerical constants (ENCs), whose value are initialized randomly and can be updated during the evolution process. Though experimental results show that the GEP-RNC algorithm is more efficient than using ENCs, it is still supported by *geppy* and can do the work for simple problems, like models which only involve integer constants. To learn about the GEP-RNC algorithm recommended for numerical constant finding in GEP, please check the example [GEP-RNC for numerical expression inference](./numerical_expression_inference.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to adopt ENCs in *geppy* is:\n",
    "+ add one or more ephemerals with `PrimitiveSet.add_ephemeral` (usually one is enough)\n",
    "+ [optional] update the ephemerals during evolution by the `mutate_uniform_ephemeral` operator."
