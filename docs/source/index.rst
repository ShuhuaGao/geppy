=====================================
Welcome to *geppy*'s documentation!
=====================================

*geppy* is an evolutionary algorithm framework specially designed for gene expression programming (GEP) in Python. *geppy* is built on top of the more general evolutionary computation framework `DEAP <https://github.com/deap/deap>`_ , which lacks support for GEP by itself. *geppy* conforms to DEAP's design philosophy that it seeks to make algorithms explicit and data structures transparent in GEP. In the following, please first check the **Get Started** part to learn the core concepts of GEP and the related important data structures, with which you can build your own GEP application easily. Then, you can go through the **Tutorials & Examples** to get yourself familiar with *geppy*.  All the APIs of *geppy* are well documented in details and can be found in the **Library Reference** part. Since *geppy* depends on DEAP, do remember to check the documentation of DEAP if you get stuck, especially the `Overview <http://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/overview.html>`_ of how a DEAP program is composed.
